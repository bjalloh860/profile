Today, The House is expected to pass the bill tomorrow, and President Biden will then be expected to sign it. The senate bill includes most of what Biden sought, including $1,400 relief payments for a majority of Americans. The process has taken weeks, with lawmakers aiming to pass the new package before current round of enhanced unemployment assistance expires on Sunday. As for stmulus, they should start arriving this month, Biden said on Saturday... <b>(src: Now This Know This)</b>  <br> <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/03/08/us/kenneth-walker-breonna-taylor-dismissed-charges/index.html#:~:text=Jefferson%20County%20Circuit%20Court%20Judge,charged%20for%20Taylor's%20actual%20killing."><button target="_blank" style="color: white; font-size: 20px; background-color: cornflowerblue; padding: 12px; margin: 40px 0 0 80px; border-radius: 5px;">click here to read more</button></a> </p>

		      	<p><b> Judge Ruling --</b>A judge permanently dismissed all charges against Kenneth Walker, Breonna Taylor’s boyfriend, yesterday. Walker had been charged with assault and attempted murder of a police officer after firing off one shot and allegedly striking a police officer in the leg during the March 2020 police raid that took Taylor's life. In the year since the raid, Walker has repeatedly insisted that he thought the officers were intruders and that he fired the gun in self-defense. His lawyer argued he was being used as a scapegoat for a raid gone wrong. None of the officers involved, who fired 32 rounds in total, killing Taylor, have been charged with her death. In an Instagram post from the weekend, Walker wrote, “I’m blessed for sure but there’s a lot more to be done we gonna get justice for Breonna Taylor. <b>(src: Now This Know This) </p>
