						<strong> Stimulus Talk -- </strong> After the senate passed a version of President Joe Biden's $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan, many Americans want to know when they'll get their $1,400 checks.

						<strong> Judge Ruling --</strong> A judge permanently dismissed all charges against Kenneth Walker, Breonna Taylor’s boyfriend, yesterday. Walker had been charged with assault and attempted murder of a police officer after firing off one shot and allegedly striking a police officer in the leg during the March 2020 police raid that took Taylor's life. In the year since the raid, Walker has repeatedly insisted that he thought the officers were intruders and that he fired the gun in self-defense. His lawyer argued he was being used as a scapegoat for a raid gone wrong. None of the officers involved, who fired 32 rounds in total, killing Taylor, have been charged with her death. In an Instagram post from the weekend, Walker wrote, “I’m blessed for sure but there’s a lot more to be done we gonna get justice for Breonna Taylor. <b>(src: Now This Know This)</b>
